# Good Wolf

Good Wolf is a minimalist color scheme. [Steve Losh](https://stevelosh.com/projects/badwolf/) created the dark version of Good Wolf for Vim as a "syntax less" variant of Bad Wolf.

## Good Wolf for Sublime Text

This color scheme is created for Sublime Text. In need of a similar nice light color scheme, I created Good Wolf (light) that has some tweaks but otherwise keeps the Spirit of Good Wolf.

To install it, look for "Good Wolf Color Scheme" in [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Good%20Wolf%20Color%20Scheme).
