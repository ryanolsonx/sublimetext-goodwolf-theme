# Good Wolf

Good Wolf is a minimalist color scheme. [Steve Losh](https://stevelosh.com/projects/badwolf/) created Good Wolf for Vim as a "syntax less" variant of Bad Wolf.

## Good Wolf for Sublime Text

This color scheme is created for Sublime Text. I've added a light version of Good Wolf along with a port of the dark version (from Vim).

To install it, look for "Good Wolf Color Scheme" in [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Good%20Wolf%20Color%20Scheme).
